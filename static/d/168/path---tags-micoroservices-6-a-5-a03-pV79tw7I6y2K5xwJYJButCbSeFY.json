The evanglists behind microservice approach have built the case around speed, scalability and cohesion stating in that a microservice Change is easy, Units are small, scalability is semi infinite. So what is Microservice architecture? Microservices — also known as the microservice architecture — is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities.</p>\n<p>We will discuss and summarize some of the implementation factors that have big impact on indicators of success in your project/software delivery viz:</p>\n<p><strong>Law of repository management</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most active moving part of micro services is code repositories. They can be categorised into two broader areas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mono Repository i.e. keep all the services in the same repository</li>\n<li>Multiple Repositories i.e. keep separate repositories for each of the services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Majority of microservices evolve over a period of time and it has been observed that based on team and organisation stucutures derives the strategy adobted for code management. Usually it naturally tends towards multiple repository pattern due of diverse practices followed in an organization among various units. This results in poor code reusabiliy but also provides clear boundaries of ownership. The problem of reusability can be resolve by implementing re-usable package, e.g. nugets for .net or npm for node etc. As the number of services grows it becomes difficult to debug and cross teams development. Moreover overall platform knowledge becomes fragmented and abstract due to focused development teams.</p>\n<p>For a larger project it is recomended to use Mono repository with clear segrigation of domin functionality and shared core reusability. This brings standardisation is development style and practices. It provides better integration capabilities and debugging at the cost of larger code base.
