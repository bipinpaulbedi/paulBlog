The evanglists behind microservice approach have built the case around speed, scalability and cohesion stating in that a microservice Change is easy, Units are small, scalability is semi infinite. So what is Microservice architecture? Microservices — also known as the microservice architecture — is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services, which implement business capabilities.</p>\n<p>We will discuss and summarize some of the implementation factors that have big impact on indicators of success in your project/software delivery viz:</p>\n<p><strong>Law of repository management</strong></p>\n<p>One of the most active moving part of micro services is code repositories. They can be categorised into two broader areas.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mono Repository i.e. keep all the services in the same repository</li>\n<li>Multiple Repositories i.e. keep separate repositories for each of the services</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Majority of microservices evolve over a period of time and it has been observed that based on team and organisation stucutures derives the strategy adobted for code management. Usually it naturally tends towards multiple repository pattern due of diverse practices followed in an organization among various units. This results in poor code reusabiliy but also provides clear boundaries of ownership. The problem of reusability can be resolve by implementing re-usable package, e.g. nugets for .net or npm for node etc. As the number of services grows it becomes difficult to debug and cross teams development. Moreover overall platform knowledge becomes fragmented and abstract due to focused development teams.</p>\n<p>For a larger project it is recomended to use Mono repository with clear segrigation of domin functionality and shared core reusability. This brings standardisation is development style and practices. It provides better integration capabilities and debugging at the cost of larger code base. Most programming framework provides modular development approach where we can leverage best of both world of mono repo for development and multi repo for build and release.</p>\n<p><strong>Law of seperation of concern</strong></p>\n<p>The most common dilemma that microservice bring into an architects plate is regarding granuality of functionality. As per recomended practice the domain driven development leads to correct size of bounded context which is articulated based on various business activities and influence. Usually, in real world it has been noticed that business units and generated based on software boundaries. Nevertheless using microservices does not implies less code, rather it focus on maintainablity and scalability. If you are planning to create a microservice for each functionality then it is definately planning for diaster.</p>\n<p>The mutual independence across multiple microservices is te core principle behind this architecture. Each service shall ideally implement its own data persistence and caching capabilities. The owner service defines the strategy to create, manipulate and consume service. The external services should not be entertaining data access directly but shall only pass through owner service interfaces only.</p>\n<p>The cross cutting concers such as authentication shall be abstracted to gateways such as azure api management, <a href=\"http://threemammals.com/ocelot\">ocelot</a>. In certain senarios a aggregator microservice might be required from client or as a server rapper to avoid multiple dependenct hell.</p>\n<p><strong>Law of eventual consistency</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Law of scalable deployment</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Law of green initiation</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Law of brown transition</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Law of implementation patterns</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Law of communication</strong></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 28, 2019","title":"9 laws of architecting microservices"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"micoroservices"}}
